2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe . the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm . for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010

information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of

was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities . investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across

to $ 820 million in 2010 , $ 852 million in 2009 , and $ 926 million in 2008 . we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years . acquisitions , divestitures and other activities 2013 acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates . amounts paid in 2010 of $ 148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates . we paid $ 435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities , compared with $ 233 million in 2008 . in 2010 , we received proceeds of $ 798

We need to calculate the total number of shares purchased during November 2007 and multiply it by the average price paid per share.\n\nFrom the table, we have:\n- October 1 to October 28: 705292 shares purchased at $53.53\n- October 29 to November 25: 431170 shares purchased at $48.11\n- November 26 to December 31: 8310 shares purchased at $44.99\n\nWe need to find the total number of shares purchased during November 2007.\nFrom October 29 to November 25, we have 431170 shares purchased.\nFrom November 26 to December 31, we have 8310 shares purchased.\nTotal number of shares purchased during November 2007 = 431170 + 8310 = 439480\n\nTotal cost of shares purchased during November 2007 = 439480 * (53.53 + 48.11) / 2 = 439480 * 50.87 / 2 = 439480 * 25.435 = 113,000,000\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the total number of shares purchased during November 2007 as follows:\nFrom October 29 to November 25: 431170 shares purchased at $48.11\nFrom November 26 to December 31: 8310 shares purchased at $44.99\nTotal number of shares purchased = 431170 + 8310 = 439480\nTotal cost = 439480 * 48.11 = 21,000,000\nTotal cost = 8310 * 44.99 = 37,000,000\nTotal cost = 21,000,000 + 37,000,000 = 58,000,000\n\nThe total number of shares purchased during November 2007 is 431170 + 8310 = 439480.\nThe average price paid per share is (48.11 + 44.99) / 2 = 46.55.\nTotal cost = 439480 * 46.55 = 20,600,000\n\nThe total number of shares purchased during November 2007 is 431170 + 8310 = 439480.\nThe average price paid per share is (53.53 + 48"}

) , from the prior year . higher net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees . for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report . principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains . trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments . also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) . for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report . lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction . for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report . asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report . the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio . also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares . for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains ( losses ) , which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business , see

arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments . an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average . for example , the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range . 2030 the ranges , averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative . for example , the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative . accordingly , the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in , or possible ranges of , fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives . 2030 interest rates , currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models , credit derivatives are valued using option pricing , correlation and discounted cash flow models , and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models . 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques . for example , option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value . therefore , the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques . 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation . 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas . 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products . range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments : 2030 correlation . ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type ( e.g. , equity index and equity single stock names ) and across product types ( e.g. , correlation of an interest rate and a currency ) , as well as across regions . generally , cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type . 2030 volatility . ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets , maturities and strike prices . for example , volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks . 2030 credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates . the ranges for credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers ( index and single names ) , regions , sectors , maturities and credit qualities ( high-yield and investment-grade ) . the broad range of this population
